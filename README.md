Predicting stock prices is a fundamental yet complex task in financial markets due to their highly volatile and unpredictable nature. Traditional models often fail to account for the inherent randomness and risk in stock price movements. Monte Carlo Simulation offers a probabilistic approach by modeling thousands of possible future price paths based on historical data and stochastic processes. This method helps in better understanding the range of potential outcomes, making it a valuable tool for risk analysis and informed investment decision-making.
Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Prediction
The Monte Carlo method simulates a large number of possible price paths for a stock based on random sampling, usually assuming the price follows a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

Geometric Brownian Motion Formula:
“St​\=S0​⋅e(μ−2σ2​)t+σWt​”
Where: 
St​ is the stock price at time t
S0​ is the current stock price  
μ is the expected return (drift)  
σ is the volatility 
Wt​ is a Wiener process (standard Brownian motion)
